                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1365807">Wikipedia</a>:
                Sudoku (数独 sūdoku, digit-single) (/suːˈdoʊkuː/, /-ˈdɒk-/, /sə-/,
                originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial
                number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with
                digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3
                subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or
                "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter
                provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle
                has a single solution.

                <p>Completed games are always a type of Latin square with an
                additional constraint on the contents of individual regions.
                For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in
                the same row, column, or any of the nine 3×3 subregions of the 9×9
                playing board. </p>

            	<p><b>WASD</b> and <b>arrow keys</b> control the cursor; allowing it to move to adjacent 
            	spaces. Additionally, <b>clicking</b> a tile moves the cursor to that tile. Keys <b>1-9</b> 
            	place a corresponding digit/note/color into the selection. <b>Space 
            	bar</b> rotates between input "modes." Holding <b>shift</b> quick-switches to note taking 
            	or "pencil marking." <b>Clicking and dragging</b> selects all tiles hovered over with the
            	mouse. Holding <b>control</b> adds any selected tiles to the current selection (either 
            	with arrow key controls or mouse controls). <b>Enter</b> toggles locking the selected digits, 
            	so they cannot be altered.</p>

				<h2>Basic Strategy</h2>
				<h3>Only choice</h3>
				<p>It is generally recommended to start a standard sudoku by
				going over each digit and determining if, for each subregion, there
				is only one position that digit can take. Here, in the upper right
				subregion, there is only one place
				a 1 can go. The 1st row, 2nd row, 7th column, and 9th column all
				other contain 1s, so the tile in the 3rd row, 8th column (C8) must
				contain a 1.</p>

				<p>The same strategy may be used in rows and columns, as opposed
					to subregions. Above, we see that there is only one location in
					column 8 where a 1 can go, so it must be that a 1 is in this location
					(A8)</p>

				<h3>Single Possibility</h3>
				<p>In the next example, it can be deduced that the center tile (E5)
				must be a 1, because all other possibilities can be eliminated.</p>

				<h3>Snyder notation</h3>
				<p>A note or pencil mark indicates where it is <em>possible</em>
				for a digit to be. The naïve approach to pencil marking is to fill
				every possibility for very tile. While this may reveal single
				possibilities it quickly becomes too crowded and obfuscates useful
				information. This poses the question: when should I pencil mark?
				While there is no absolute answer, there is a good guiding principle
				which should be followed if possible: Snyder notation.</p>

				<p>Snyder notation says to pencil mark only when the number of
				possibilities in a subregion for a digit is equal to 2 (of course
				if it were 1, you would know where the digit is). This keeps the
				total number of pencil marks down while providing 90+ percent of
				the useful information. Most tricks will not rely on more than 2
				notes in one region.</p>

				<p>Note: You may find it useful pencil if there are only 2 places
				for a digit to go in a row or column but it is NOT true for the
				subregions which contain those pencil marks, this <em>is</em> useful but
				can be confusing if you forget that you have broken standard notation.</p>

				<h3>Pointing pairs</h3>
				<p>One helpful way to perceive the board is too look for so-called "pointing 
				pairs." Pointing pairs occur when (using Snyder notation) two notes within one
				sub-region are confined within the same row or column. The effect this has is
				that no other tiles in that row/column can contain that digit.</p>

				<p>Here we see that a 1 can be deduced using pointing pairs in H6. The logic 
				follows thusly: 1 is either in B5 or C5, in either case 1 is in column 5. So 
				then, because G5 and H5 are in column 5 and are not B5 or C5, they cannot contain 
				a 1. Therefor it is trivial to see that a 1 must be in H6.</p>
